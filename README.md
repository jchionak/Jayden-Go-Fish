# Jayden-Go-Fish
A go fish game, along with files for cards, a deck of cards, and go fish players. 

If you just want to play Go Fish, run the go_fish_game.py. 

The game will just run in the terminal.

The card.py module contains the Card data class for representing traditional playing cards in Python. Cards have a value, suit, and colour.

The deck.py module contains the Deck class, which is designed to hold cards. It is implemented using a list. 

The player.py module contains the abstract superclass Player, as well as subclasses HumanPlayer and ComputerPlayer. These represent Go Fish players, with a name, hand, and matches. 

Feel free to use the Card and Deck modules to hopefully build some other card games!
